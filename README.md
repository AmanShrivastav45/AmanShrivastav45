<h2>Hey there! I'm Aman Shrivastav</h2>
<p align="justify">Hi there! I’m a software engineer who spends half my time writing code and the other half stuck in a paradox—when it doesn’t work, I have no idea why; when it does work… I still have no idea why. While optimists see the glass as half full and pessimists see it as half empty, I believe it is a classic case of over-allocation: "I mean why is this glass twice as big as it needs to be?". My life is a never-ending cycle of writing bugs, fixing them, and accidentally creating new ones in the process. I believe in clean code, but my debugger strongly disagrees. If you ever see me staring blankly at my screen, don’t worry—I’m either deep in thought or just waiting for Stack Overflow to load.</p>
